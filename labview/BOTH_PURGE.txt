# WELCOME TO THE AUTO SEQUENCE COMMANDS FILE.
# Command Format:
#   (NOTE: Read about specific commands in "COMMANDS_README.txt")
#   (NOTE: CAPITALIZATION MATTERS!)
#   For commands with no arguments (rare): <command>
#   For commands with arguments: <command> >> <argument>
#   For multi-argument comands: <command> >> <argument1>,<argument2>,...,<argument3>
# Comments:
#   On any line, all text after "#" or "//" is considered a comment like in normal programming and is thrown out by the command parser.
#   If you don't want a command to run, simply put a "#" at the start of the line.
# Procedures:
#   Any given test (cold flow, hot fire) will need modifications to some arguments in this file.
#   If you don't remember which command arguments to modify, in this file press Ctrl+f and search for "//!".
#   These should be inline comments that point out arguments that are often changed per test.
#   It will tell you you what the argument means.
