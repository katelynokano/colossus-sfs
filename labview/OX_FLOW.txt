# WELCOME TO THE AUTO SEQUENCE COMMANDS FILE.
# Command Format:
#   (NOTE: Read about specific commands in "COMMANDS_README.txt")
#   (NOTE: CAPITALIZATION MATTERS!)
#   For commands with no arguments (rare): <command>
#   For commands with arguments: <command> >> <argument>
#   For multi-argument comands: <command> >> <argument1>,<argument2>,...,<argument3>
# Comments:
#   On any line, all text after "#" or "//" is considered a comment like in normal programming and is thrown out by the command parser.
#   If you don't want a command to run, simply put a "#" at the start of the line.
# Procedures:
#   Any given test (cold flow, hot fire) will need modifications to some arguments in this file.
#   If you don't remember which command arguments to modify, in this file press Ctrl+f and search for "//!".
#   These should be inline comments that point out arguments that are often changed per test.
#   It will tell you you what the argument means.
### PRE-PROCEDURES ###
# Check that the ESTOP is not hit
ARMED >> On
# Start data logger and confirm status
LOG_TRIG_ON >> On
LOG_TRIG_STATUS >> On
Status >> Logger is now on
# Detect that all actuators are plugged in (NOTE: we cannot check any valves that are being powered, such as DET_PRESS_FU or both vents)
DET_PRESS_OX >> On
DET_MAIN_OX >> On
DET_VENT_OX >> On
# Set all actuators to the initial states for the sequence
ACT_EMATCH >> Off

ACT_SIREN >> On
# Automated OX Tank pressurization.
#   This batch of commands will begin pressurization of the OX tank
#   and read the pressure sensor until it reaches the argument value PSI,
#   and only then will move on to the next command.
#   You can comment out these lines if you want to do manual pressurization, but ensure that you modify "..._PRESS_OX >> Close" commands above to be "Open".
Status >> Waiting for OX Tank Pressurization
ACT_PRESS_OX >> Open
FBK_PRESS_OX >> Open
Wait for OX Tank Pressure >> 740 //! THE PRESSURE (PSI) THAT THE OX TANK SHOULD REACH
ACT_SIREN >> Off
